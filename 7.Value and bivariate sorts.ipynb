    "A fundamental problem in handling accounting data is the *look-ahead bias* - we must not include data in forming a portfolio that is not public knowledge at the time. Of course, researchers have more information when looking into the past than agents had at that moment. However, abnormal excess returns from a trading strategy should not rely on an information advantage because the differential cannot be the result of informed agents' trades. Hence, we have to lag accounting information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue to lag market capitalization and firm size by one month. Then, we compute the book-to-market ratio, which relates a firm's book equity to its market equity. Firms with high (low) book-to-market are called value (growth) firms. After matching the accounting and market equity information from the same month, we lag book-to-market by six months. This is a sufficiently conservative approach because accounting information is usually released well before six months pass. However, in the asset pricing literature, even longer lags are used as well.^[The definition of a time lag is another choice a researcher has to make, similar to breakpoint choices as we describe in the section on p-hacking.]\n",

The final step in our data preparation deals with differences in the frequency of our variables. Returns and firm size are recorded monthly. Yet the accounting information is only released on an annual basis. Hence, we only match book-to-market to one month per year and have eleven empty observations. To solve this frequency issue, we carry the latest book-to-market ratio of each firm to the subsequent months, i.e., we fill the missing observations with the most current report. This is done via the `fillna()`-function after sorting by date and firm (which we identify by permno and gvkey) and on a firm basis (which we do by `groupby()` as usual). As the last step, we remove all rows with missing entries because the returns cannot be matched to any annual report."
